  <p>
  I am a data scientist and R programmer currently working
  on <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> development. I recently
  completed a master's in library and information science at the University of
  Washington, where I focused on data visualization.

  <p>
  I advocate for open science, reproducible research, and diversity and social
  justice in STEM. I also collect data visualizations gone beautifully wrong on
  a blog called <a href="http://accidental-art.tumblr.com/">accidental aRt</a>.
