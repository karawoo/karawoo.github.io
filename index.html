  <p>
    I am a senior data science engineer
    at <a href="https://www.insight-rx.com/">InsightRX</a> where I work on R
    tooling, data products, and infrastructure. Prior to joining InsightRX I led
    a team of engineers building tools for data sharing and collaborative
    research at Sage Bionetworks. I've also previously worked as an information
    manager at Washington State University and at the National Center for
    Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), where I combined data management
    with fieldwork at a remote Siberian lake.

    I'm an enthusiastic R programmer, and I collect data visualizations gone
    beautifully wrong on the twitter
    account <a href="https://twitter.com/accidental__aRt">@accidental__aRt</a>.
    When I'm not writing R code I can usually be found playing with my dog and
    cats.
