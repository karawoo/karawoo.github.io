  <p>I work at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (but am
    located at Washington State University), ensuring that data for the
    <a href="http://baikaldimensions.wordpress.com">Lake Baikal Dimensions of
      Biodiversity</a> project are responsibly managed and archived. In addition
    to data management and aquatic ecology I am passionate about science
    communication, open science, reproducible research, and diversity in STEM.
