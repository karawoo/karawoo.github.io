  <p>
    I am an engineer who builds software for data science. I love removing
    friction so people can work more efficiently with data, whether that work is
    marketing measurement, precision dosing, finding new drug targets for
    Alzheimer's disease, or understanding the effects of climate change in
    Siberia. I currently work as a senior software engineer
    at <a href="https://getrecast.com">Recast</a>.
