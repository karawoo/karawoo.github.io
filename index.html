  <p>
    I am a research scientist and data wrangler based in Seattle, WA. I've
    previously worked as a contributor
    to <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, and as an
    information manager at Washington State University and at the National
    Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). I completed a master's
    in library and information science at the University of Washington, where I
    focused on data visualization.

  <p>
    I collect data visualizations gone beautifully wrong on a blog
    called <a href="http://accidental-art.tumblr.com/">accidental aRt</a>, and
    when I'm not writing R code I can often be found in a ballet studio.
