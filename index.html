  I am a master's student in library and information science at the University
  of Washington Information School. My coursework is mostly in data science,
  visualization, and data management, and I advocate for open science,
  reproducible research, and diversity and social justice in STEM. I also
  collect data visualizations gone beautifully wrong on a blog
  called <a href="http://accidental-art.tumblr.com/">accidental aRt</a>.
