  <p>
    I am a research scientist in data curation
    at <a href="http://sagebionetworks.org/">Sage Bionetworks</a>, where I help
    other researchers document and share their data. I've previously worked as
    an information manager at Washington State University and at the National
    Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), where I combined data
    management with fieldwork at a remote Siberian lake.

    I'm an enthusiastic R programmer, and I collect data visualizations gone
    beautifully wrong on a blog
    called <a href="http://accidental-art.tumblr.com/">accidental aRt</a>. When
    I'm not writing R code I can often be found in a ballet studio.
