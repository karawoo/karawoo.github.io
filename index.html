  <p>I am an information manager at the National Center for Ecological Analysis
    and Synthesis where I ensure that data for the
    <a href="http://baikaldimensions.wordpress.com">Lake Baikal Dimensions of
      Biodiversity</a> project is responsibly managed and archived. In addition
      to data management and aquatic ecology I am interested in science
      communication, open science, reproducible research, and diversity in STEM.
