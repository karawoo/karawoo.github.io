  <p>
  I am a master's student in library and information science at the University
  of Washington Information School. I am also an information manager at
  Washington State University where I work
  in <a href="http://environment.wsu.edu/people/faculty/hampton.html">Stephanie
  Hampton's</a> research group. My interests are in data management,
  visualization, open science, reproducible research, and diversity and social
  justice in STEM. I also collect data visualizations gone beautifully wrong
  on <a href="http://accidental-art.tumblr.com/">accidental aRt</a> and teach
  programming to scientists
  with <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>
  and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>.
