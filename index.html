  <p>
    I am a data scientist and educator based in Seattle, WA. I currently work as a
    curriculum lead at <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to joining DataCamp I worked on
    <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> development and
    completed a master's in library and information science at the University of
    Washington, where I focused on data visualization.
  </p>
  <p>
    I advocate for open science, reproducible research, and diversity and social
    justice in STEM. I also collect data visualizations gone beautifully wrong on
    a blog called <a href="http://accidental-art.tumblr.com/">accidental aRt</a>.
