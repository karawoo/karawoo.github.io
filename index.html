  <p>
    I am a principal bioinformatics engineer
    at <a href="http://sagebionetworks.org/">Sage Bionetworks</a>, where I lead
    a team of developers building tools and infrastructure for open science.
    I've previously worked as an information manager at Washington State
    University and at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis
    (NCEAS), where I combined data management with fieldwork at a remote
    Siberian lake.

  <p>
    I'm an enthusiastic R programmer, and I collect data visualizations gone
    beautifully wrong on a blog
    called <a href="http://accidental-art.tumblr.com/">accidental aRt</a>. When
    I'm not writing R code I can often be found in a ballet studio or a
    bouldering gym.
